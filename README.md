I have created a Word Puzzle Game in which the user has to form the correct word out of a given set of characters. In the game the user has to solve this puzzle for words, one at a time. Problem words are stored in a list and appear to the user in random sequence. Give the user score +1 for each correct answer and give -1 for each wrong answer. At last print the final score. You can store any number of words in the list, butin each round of the game only 5 words are shown to the user.
